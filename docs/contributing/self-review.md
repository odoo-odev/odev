# Self review

You should always review your own PR before submitting it.

For content changes make sure that you:

-   [x] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is
        one).
-   [x] Compare your changes to the `main` branch to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is
        working as expected.
-   [x] Review the entire pull request for typos in comments and doctrings.
-   [x] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they are all passing.
-   [x] Make sure the version number in `odev/_version.py` has been incremented according to
        [semantic versioning standards](https://semver.org/).
