# Working in the Odev repository

Here's some information that may be helpful while working on an Odev PR:

-   **Setup** - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine.
-   **Styling** - How code is kept coherent and readable for all involved developers.
-   **Reusable modules** - Generic methods and classes are defined separately and imported when necessary.
-   **Pre-Commit** - Pre-Commit hooks are used to ensure consistency and correctness of the codebase. They run
    automatically in your PR but it is recommended to run them locally too.
-   **Tests** - Tests are used to ensure changes do not break existing features. Tests run automatically in your PR, and
    sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.
-   **Upgrades** - Sometimes a change in the code requires modifying the app' structure. Migration scripts are used to
    ensure this remains transparent to the end user.
