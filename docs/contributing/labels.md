# Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

-   The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/odoo-odev/odev/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
    is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
-   The
    [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/odoo-odev/odev/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
    is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
-   The [`bug` label](https://github.com/odoo-odev/odev/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) is for problems in
    the source code of Odev. These will usually require some knowledge of Python and the Odev framework.
-   The [`enhancement` label](https://github.com/odoo-odev/odev/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) is
    for new features or updates in the source code of Odev. These will usually require a greater knowledge of the Odev
    framework.
