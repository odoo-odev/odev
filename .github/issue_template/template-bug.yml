        - **Styling:** Styling issue or typo, not important but nice to have.
        - **Low:** Unimportant issue that does not prevent the good functioning of `odev` or a workaround exists.
        - **Blocking:** `odev` or one of its features is crashing and cannot be used.
        - **Catastrophic:** Other parts of the system are impacted by an action taken by `odev`.
