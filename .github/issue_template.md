## Classification

Is this a bug report or a request for a missing feature (choose one):

- [ ] Bug report
- [ ] New feature request / enhancement

What is this issue's criticality (choose one)?

> *Note*
>
> How to choose the criticality level:
>
> - **Quality of life:** could be better but I can live without it (i.e. typo, missing log, display issue)
> - **Nice to have:** will improve the global flow but is not utterly necessary or a workaround exists (i.e. chain two commands,...)
> - **Blocking:** a feature cannot be used or other tools are needed (i.e. an error is raised, an essential feature is missing,...)
> - **Critical:** the tool is broken or other parts of my system have been impacted (i.e. `odev` deleted my root directory, multiple commands are broken,...)

- [ ] Quality of life
- [ ] Nice to have
- [ ] Blocking
